# Deterministic

This is a spiritual successor of the [Monadic gem](http://github.com/pzol/monadic). The goal of the rewrite is to get away from a bit to forceful aproach I took in Monadic, especially when it comes to coercing monads, but also a more practical but at the same time more strict adherence to monad laws.

This gem is still __WORK IN PROGRESS__.

## Usage

The first think you need to do is include the helpers:

```
include Deterministic::Helpers
```

This will include **three** methods: the `Success` & `Failure` method helpers, and the `attempt_all` helper.

If you prefer not to use the helpers, here are the equivalents:

```ruby
# attempt_all do
# end
Deterministic::Either.attempt_all do
end

# Success(:some_val)
Deterministic::Success.new(:some_val)

# Failure(:some_val)
Deterministic::Failure.new(:some_val)
```

### Either#attempt_all

The basic idea is to execute a chain of units of work and make sure all return either `Success` or `Failure`.

```ruby
attempt_all do
  try { 1 }
  try { |prev| prev + 1 }
end # => Success(2)
```
Take notice, that the result of of unit of work will be passed to the next one. So the result of prepare_somehing will be something in the second try.

If any of the units of work in between fail, the rest will not be executed and the last `Failure` will be returned.

```ruby
attempt_all do
  try { 1 }
  try { raise "error" }
  try { 2 }
end # => Failure(RuntimeError("error"))
```

However, the real fun starts if you use it with your own context. You can use this as a state container (meh!) or to pass a dependency locator:

```ruby
  class Context
    attr_accessor :env, :settings
    def some_service
    end
  end

  # exemplary unit of work
  module LoadSettings
    def self.call(env)
      settings = load(env)
      settings.nil? ? Failure('could not load settings') : Success(settings)
    end

    def load(env)
    end
  end

  attempt_all(context) do
    # this unit of work explicitly returns success or failure
    # no exceptions are catched and if they occur, well, they behave as expected
    # methods from the context can be accessed, the use of self for setters is necessary
    let { self.settings = LoadSettings.call(env) }

    # with #try all exceptions will be transformed into a Failure
    try { do_something }
  end
```

### Pattern matching
Now that you have some result, you want to control flow by providing patterns.
`#match` can match by

 * success, failure, either or any
 * values
 * lambdas
 * classes

```ruby
Success(1).match do
  success { |v| "success #{v}"}
  failure { |v| "failure #{v}"}
  either  { |v| "either #{v}"}
end # => "success 1"
```
Note1: the inner value has been unwrapped! 

Note2: only the __first__ matching pattern block will be executed, so order __can__ be important.

The result returned will be the result of the __first__ `#try` or `#let`. As a side note, `#try` is a monad, `#let` is a functor.

Values for patterns are good, too:

```ruby
Success(1).match do
  success(1) {|v| "Success #{v}" }
end # => "Success 1"
```

You can and should also use procs for patterns:

```ruby
Success(1).match do
  success ->(v) { v == 1 } {|v| "Success #{v}" }
end # => "Success 1"
```

Also you can match the result class

```ruby
Success([1, 2, 3]).match do
  success(Array) { |v| v.first }
end # => 1
```

Combining `#attempt_all` and `#match` is the ultimate sophistication:

```ruby
attempt_all do
  try { 1 }
  try { |v| v + 1 }
end.match do
  success(1) { |v| "We made it to step #{v}" }
  success(2) { |v| "The correct answer is #{v}"}
end # => "The correct answer is 2"
```

If no match was found a `NoMatchError` is raised, so make sure you always cover all possible outcomes.

```ruby
Success(1).match do
  failure(1) { "you'll never get me" }
end # => NoMatchError
```

A way to have a catch-all would be using an `any`:

```ruby
Success(1).match do
  any { "catch-all" }
end # => "catch-all"
```

## Inspirations
 * My [Monadic gem](http://github.com/pzol/monadic) of course
 * `#attempt_all` was somewhat inspired by [An error monad in Clojure](http://brehaut.net/blog/2011/error_monads)
 * [Pithyless' rumblings](https://gist.github.com/pithyless/2216519) 
 * [either by rsslldnphy](https://github.com/rsslldnphy/either)
 * [Functors, Applicatives, And Monads In Pictures](http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html)
